Basic Commands
--------------


Setting Up MongoDB Database
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* To setup a **MongoDB Database**, just go to BASE/settings/base.py, 
find  DATABASES and fill out / correct out the required details. Once you save it, its done. 

Docker 
^^^^^^
* Go to terminal and run the following command to build the stack of project. ::

    $ docker-compose -f production.yml build

Now we may run::

    $ docker-compose -f local.yml up

Or::

    $ docker-compose -f production.yml up

If you are using local.yml, To Detach containers run::

    $ docker-compose -f local.yml up -d 

To Migrate::

    $ docker-compose -f local.yml --rm django python manage.py makemigrations

    $ docker-compose -f local.yml --rm django python manage.py migrate

For logs::

    $ docker-compose -f local.yml logs



Setting Up Your Users
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* To create a **normal user account**, just go to Sign Up and fill out the form. Once you submit it, you'll see a "Verify Your E-mail Address" page. Go to your console to see a simulated email verification message. Copy the link into your browser. Now the user's email should be verified and ready to go.

* To create an **superuser account**, use this command::

    $ docker-compose -f local.yml --rm django python manage.py  createsuperuser

For convenience, you can keep your normal user logged in on Chrome and your superuser logged in on Firefox (or similar), so that you can see how the site behaves for both kinds of users.
